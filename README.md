# SVG Logo generator
This is a Node.js command-line application that generates an SVG file of a logo based on user input. The logo consists of a text and a shape that can be one of the following: circle, triangle, or square. The user can also choose the colors of the text and the shape by entering a color keyword or a hexadecimal number.



## How to use
Run the following command on the command line:

node index.js

The application will prompt the user for the following information:

Three characters for the text of the logo:
The color of the text (keyword or hexadecimal):
The shape of the logo (circle, triangle, or square):
The color of the shape (keyword or hexadecimal):

After the user enters all the information, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the same directory as the index.js file. The application will also print the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line.
